# Full Stack Open — Exercises

**Student:** Yasmin Ebrahimi  
**Course:** Full Stack Open (Open University, University of Helsinki)  


## To keep things organised, I created a React app in the `main` branch and added the exercises for each part in a separate branch.  

For example, a branch named `part0` contains the exercises for Part 0.

Branches in this repository:

- `part0` → Contains exercises for Part 0  
- `part1` → Contains exercises for Part 1  
- `part2` → Contains exercises for Part 2  
- `part3` → Contains exercises for Part 3  
- `part4` → Contains exercises for Part 4  
- `part5` → Contains exercises for Part 5  
- `part6` → Contains exercises for Part 6  
- `part7` → Contains exercises for Part 7  
- `part8` → Contains exercises for Part 8  
- `part9` → Contains exercises for Part 9  

Please check the branches to see the solutions for each part.
